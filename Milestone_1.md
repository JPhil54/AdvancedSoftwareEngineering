## Milestone 1 Report

### 1. What is your project trying to accomplish?
This project is to research Cppcheck, Clang, and Source Trail, 3 popular free open source static analyzers for C++ and to compare and contrast their effectiveness, soundness, and completeness. 

### 2. What have you done so far in your project?
So far I have selected the anlayzers to test on and research, as well as starting to go through the documentation and finding out more about each of them. I have been organizing the repository and researching how Cppcheck, Clang, and Source Trail rank in effectiveness, completeness, and soundness.

### 3. What do you plan to do by the next milestone?
By the next milestone I will have completed setting up the repository, uploaded C++ test programs, as well as have the introduction to my project report completed. I will then begin testing my test programs using the 3 different static analyzers to compare effectiveness, completness, and soundness.
